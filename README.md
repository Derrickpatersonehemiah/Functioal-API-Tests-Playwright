# Playwright-Tests

Created 3 tests using playwright Node.js and some of its features,

*OrangeHRM - Pure Functionality test of operations in Recruitment module constructed as POM and as a data driven test (contains 3 sets of data)
*DemoBlaze - API test of lifecycle of a product in a cart without POM
*Parabank - API test of logging in and verification of banking methods as POM and as a data driven test (contains 1 set of data)

Note: made for practicing purpose, some functionality may not work due to changes in data availablity
